Project Title:
**Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning:-**


**Description:**
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict employee attrition within an organization. By analyzing various factors such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance ratings, the models will help identify employees at risk of leaving the company. The target audience for this project includes HR professionals, managers, and decision-makers who seek insights into employee retention strategies and workforce management.
